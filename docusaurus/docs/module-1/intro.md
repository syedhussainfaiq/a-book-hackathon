# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module covers the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for robotic applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the core components of ROS 2: Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridge Python agents to ROS controllers using rclpy
- Model humanoid robots using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge in Python
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts

## Overview

This module is divided into three chapters that progressively build your understanding of ROS 2:

1. [Chapter 1: Nodes, Topics, and Services](./chapter-1-nodes-topics-services.md) - Core communication patterns
2. [Chapter 2: Bridging with rclpy](./chapter-2-rclpy-bridge.md) - Connecting Python agents to ROS
3. [Chapter 3: URDF for Humanoids](./chapter-3-urdf-humanoids.md) - Robot modeling

Let's begin by exploring the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2.
