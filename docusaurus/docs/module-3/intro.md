# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module covers the AI-powered "brain" of humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac tools, focusing on simulation and perception systems that enable intelligent behavior.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for building photorealistic simulation environments
- Generate synthetic data for training perception models
- Implement Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception pipelines
- Configure Nav2 for advanced path planning and control for bipedal humanoid robots
- Apply Visual SLAM (VSLAM) techniques for robust navigation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2 (ROS 2 and Digital Twin)
- Basic understanding of humanoid robot systems
- Familiarity with simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity from Module 2)
- Access to NVIDIA GPU hardware for Isaac tools (recommended)

## Overview

This module is divided into three chapters that progressively build your understanding of the AI-robot brain:

1. [Chapter 1: Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data](./chapter-1-isaac-sim-synthetic-data.md) - Photorealistic simulation and data generation
2. [Chapter 2: Isaac ROS and VSLAM](./chapter-2-isaac-ros-vslam.md) - Hardware-accelerated perception and navigation
3. [Chapter 3: Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation](./chapter-3-nav2-humanoid.md) - Advanced path planning for bipedal robots

Let's begin by exploring NVIDIA Isaac Sim for creating photorealistic simulation environments.
