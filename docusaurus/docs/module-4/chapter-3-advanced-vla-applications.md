# Chapter 3: Advanced VLA Applications in Humanoid Robotics

This chapter delves into advanced applications of Visual Language Agents (VLAs) in humanoid robotics. We will explore how VLAs can be used for complex task planning, scene understanding, and generating descriptive captions of the robot's environment. We will also discuss the ethical considerations and future research directions in this exciting field.
