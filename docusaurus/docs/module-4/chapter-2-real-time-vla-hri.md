# Chapter 2: Real-time VLA Processing for HRI

This chapter focuses on the challenges and solutions for real-time VLA processing in the context of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). We will explore techniques for optimizing VLA models for low-latency performance, and how to handle the continuous stream of data from the robot's sensors to enable fluid and natural interaction with humans.
