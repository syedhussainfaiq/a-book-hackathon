# Chapter 1: Connecting VLAs to Robotic Systems

This chapter covers the essential steps for connecting Visual Language Agents (VLAs) to robotic systems. We will discuss the architecture of VLA-robot integration, including hardware and software requirements, and provide practical examples of how to establish a communication bridge between the VLA and the robot's control system.
