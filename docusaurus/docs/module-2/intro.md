# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module covers digital twin technologies using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction (HRI).

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Create and configure physics simulations in Gazebo for digital twin applications
- Use Unity for rendering and visualization of digital twins with immersive HRI environments
- Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs) in digital twin environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of simulation environments
- Familiarity with humanoid robot systems
- Understanding of basic physics concepts (gravity, collisions, dynamics)

## Overview

This module is divided into three chapters that progressively build your understanding of digital twin technologies:

1. [Chapter 1: Gazebo Physics Simulation](./chapter-1-gazebo-physics.md) - Simulating real-world physics
2. [Chapter 2: Unity for Rendering and HRI](./chapter-2-unity-hri.md) - High-fidelity visual rendering and human-robot interaction
3. [Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation](./chapter-3-sensor-simulation.md) - Accurate sensor simulation for perception

Let's begin by exploring physics simulation in Gazebo.
